* Overview

Rainbow CSV is an Emacs package that provides dynamic foreground highlighting of CSV columns. Inspired by the Rainbow CSV extension in VS Code, this package highlights each CSV field using a cycling set of colors. It includes a robust parser that handles quoted fields and escaped quotes, and it offers a customizable option to switch between the original colors and a 30% lighter set.

* Features

- Highlights each CSV column with a different foreground color.
- Robust CSV field parsing that supports:
  - Quoted fields.
  - Escaped quotes.
- Customizable color sets with an option to use 30% lighter versions.
- Integrates seamlessly with Emacs's JIT-lock system for efficient highlighting.
- Automatic activation in `csv-mode` via a hook.

* Installation

Place the `rainbow-csv.el` file somewhere in your Emacs load path if you are not using a package manager. For example, if you have a directory called `~/.emacs.d/lisp/`, copy the file there and add the following to your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'rainbow-csv)
#+END_SRC

* Using use-package with built-in package loading

If you are using `use-package` and have manually installed the file or it is available in your package archive, you can integrate Rainbow CSV as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-csv
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/"  ;; adjust the path if needed
  :hook (csv-mode . rainbow-csv-enable)
  :config
  ;; Optional: Customize the color settings
  (setq rainbow-csv-use-lighter-colors t)
  (setq rainbow-csv-original-colors '("#FF0000" "#008800" "#0000FF" "#DD7700" "#990099" "#009999"))
  (setq rainbow-csv-lighter-colors '("#FF4D4D" "#4DAC4D" "#4D4DFF" "#E7A04D" "#B84DB8" "#4DB8B8"))
  ;; Ensure faces are generated with the current settings.
  (rainbow-csv--generate-faces))
#+END_SRC

* Using Straight with GitHub

If you prefer to use the Straight package manager to install Rainbow CSV directly from GitHub, you can use the following snippet. Replace `"username/rainbow-csv"` with the correct GitHub repository path:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-csv
  :straight (rainbow-csv :type git :host github :repo "NivWeisman/rainbow-csv")
  :hook (csv-mode . rainbow-csv-enable)
  :config
  ;; Optional: Customize the color settings
  (setq rainbow-csv-use-lighter-colors t)
  (setq rainbow-csv-original-colors '("#FF0000" "#008800" "#0000FF" "#DD7700" "#990099" "#009999"))
  (setq rainbow-csv-lighter-colors '("#FF4D4D" "#4DAC4D" "#4D4DFF" "#E7A04D" "#B84DB8" "#4DB8B8"))
  ;; Ensure faces are generated with the current settings.
  (rainbow-csv--generate-faces))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

1. Open a CSV file (with a `.csv` extension) in Emacs.
2. If `csv-mode` is enabled, Rainbow CSV will automatically activate via the hook and begin highlighting CSV columns.
3. To manually toggle highlighting, you can run the following commands:
   - Enable highlighting: `M-x rainbow-csv-enable`
   - Disable highlighting: `M-x rainbow-csv-disable`

* Customization

You can tweak the color lists and the toggle for lighter colors by adjusting the following variables:

- `rainbow-csv-use-lighter-colors`: Set to `t` (default) to use the lighter set, or `nil` to use the original colors.
- `rainbow-csv-original-colors`: Define your preferred original color set.
- `rainbow-csv-lighter-colors`: Define the 30% lighter versions of your colors.
